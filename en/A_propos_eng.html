            <h3>Origin of the project</h3>
            <p>The tengu road website was created for the MMi1 2022-23 individual project organised by the MMI department of the IUT Belfort Montbéliard.</p>
            <p>The idea started with the research of the general theme of the site, and the answer was quickly found, Japan and its culture was the theme which polarized me the most. And it is while looking for a theme in connection that the idea came to me.</p>
            <p>I wanted to create a travel and geolocation website and what better idea to get out of the game than by trying to reach a public often left out, but also their relatives.</p>
            <p>That's why I created a geolocation site that is even more accessible than the others, a site that really indicates the lack of accessibility of the places presented to inform people with a temporary or permanent disability, firstly by talking directly about the different risks of each place in their respective articles/leaflets, but also in a more individual way by indicating directly to the account holder whether or not the place will be accessible to him/her, thanks to a small icon that appears in the corner of the articles, leaflets and thumbnails that are linked to them.</p>

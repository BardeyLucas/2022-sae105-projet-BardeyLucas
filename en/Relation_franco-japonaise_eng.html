        <h5>Example of a narrative painting from the Nara period</h5>
        <p>Created in 1814 by Katsushika Hokusai and inspired by the narrative paintings of the Nara period. This type of literature took in 2 centenaries a very strong importance in our respective culture, even if in France, this said tsunami, arrived only very late in 1990 with the French translation of the novel akira to finally grow in the year 96 with the importation of a 40éne of series cult she that Nicky larson, slam dunk or detective conan. This development, although made difficult by the anti-manga crisis launched in 1990 by the media and certain politicians, contributed to creating strong links between the readers of these two countries and over the years several works were reciprocally produced in homage to our respective cultures.</p>

        <p>Both unimaginable and perfectly logical, this legendary work of Victor Hugo deserved to be exported beyond the limits of the novel and this is what Arai Takahiro has achieved with the help of his publisher (the Shogakukan) a work of undeniable beauty and strength, to be rediscovered in a bold and atypical format.</p>
